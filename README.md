## Data Acquisition System For Hybrid Electronic Nose

### Introduction
I developed this software during my graduate years for my thesis. I published a IEEE conference paper named "A Hybrid E-nose System based on Metal Oxide Semiconductor Gas Sensors and Compact Colorimetric Sensors" using it. It is capable of acquiring both metal oxide gas sensor data and colorimetric sensors data at the same time, and storing the signals in terms of CSV files.
